# How to Contribute
First off, thanks for contributing to Healers Diary! This helps keep the project active!

## Some Important Resources
Before you start, you might want to review some of these:-
- [Our Readme](README.md) - This helps you get acquinted with the project along with a brief timeline of what we are up to.
- [Code of Conduct]() - This outlines what is expected from you and what is not tolerated. We take our code of conduct very seriously and hope you will help us uphold it.
- [Code License](LICENSE) - All our code is freely available under this open source license. Any contributions you make will be deemed to be made under this license.
- [Dev Wiki]() - A **Work in progress**. One place to keep all developer related guides and information.

## Bugs and Feature Requests
If you found a bug or have a feature request, you can head over to [Issues]() and file a new issue. Before you do so, take some time to look through the open and closed issues to ensure this is not something we are already working on or are aware of.

If you did find a similar issue, you can leave a reaction to let us know, you are also affected by it. If you have anything to add, you can leave a comment on the issue page.

## Help us code
If you are a developer or a programmer, you might want to help us with this project. You can start working on any issue you like or even open your own issue to work on. Please make sure you leave a note on the issue page (or assign it to yourself) to make sure no one else duplicates your effort. Issues currently assigned to a project or a milestone might have higher priority.

Please try to document your code and keep your commits as short and clean as you can. We follow MVVM architecture for android code and all code is written in Kotlin. If possible, you should add test cases for your code and make sure all existing tests are passing.

After you are done, open a pull request and request to merge in the master branch. Ensure there are no conflicts (and resolve them on your side, if needed). Link the PR to an open issue, a project or a milestone and request review from any collaborator. We will take it from there!

### Branch Naming Convention
- `master` - The main development branch. All PRs are made to this branch.
- `releases/*` - Branches to store currently released versions of the app. Updated from master.
- `feature/*`, `chore/*`, `bug/*`, `hotfix/*` - Active work branches. Mention a descriptive but short name, like - `feature/add_core_module`.

## Help us Document
If you can't code (or just don't want to), you can help us in documenting the project as well. You can contribute to the wiki or improve any existing docs in the repository. Good code is useless without documentation so we believe documentation is as important as (if not more than) writing good code.

## Sponsor the project
If you like this project, please consider sponsoring this project. You can check the sponsor button on the top to see how you can help the project financially.

## Security issues
If you found a critical security issue, please **DO NOT** open a public issue. Instead, email us at teamhealersdiary@gmail.com with complete details. Please give us adequate time to deal with the issue and don't disclose any details publicly which can harm our users.

### Bug bounty
For reporting extremely critical issues, you might receive a reward as determined by our collaborators. This reward is subject to availability of funds. For similar issues, the first person to report it will be rewarded. In some cases, people reprting already known issues with extra details (which can prove helpful in resolving it) might also be rewarded.

## Roadmap
For our current and future goals, have a look at our ongoing projects and open milestones. For any queries, feel free to open an issue or discuss it in the discussions section at top
