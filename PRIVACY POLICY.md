# Privacy Policy
This policy is applicable to all users of the app starting v2.0.0. If you are using an older version, please check [This page](https://github.com/yashovardhan99/HealersDiary/blob/stable/PRIVACY%20POLICY.md)

## Introduction
Yashovardhan Dhanania ("I", "Me") along with any other service providers ("We") provides this Privacy policy to explain to you ("User"), user of the app Healers Diary ("app"), what information I may collect from you and how I will use it.

By using my app and services, you agree to this privacy policy and other [terms of service](https://github.com/yashovardhan99/HealersDiary/blob/master/EULA.md). If you do not agree to this policy, please uninstall the app and send me an email at yashovardhan99@outlook.com requesting deletion of your data. Such requests will be complied with in accordance with this [License Agreement](https://github.com/yashovardhan99/HealersDiary/blob/master/EULA.md).

## What do I collect

By using this app, you may provide me with the following information:

- Your Personal Information - If you choose to import data from v1.0 of the app, you need to sign in with your Google account. By signing in with Google, you provide information such as your email ID and name. This information is used for authenticating your account and is stored in secure servers to help identify your data as yours.
- Online sync - Online sync may be added later. If you choose to use that facility, your data may be synced to a secure server online.
- Anonymous usage data - to help improve the app, I use third party services to collect such data. A description of this is given in the sections below.

## How do I collect and store
- Firestore - I used Cloud Firestore by Firebase to securely store your data online in v1.0 of the app. You can retreive data from the firestore servers if you choose to. I have added security rules which only allow you to access your data. No other user of this app can access your data under these security rules. Your Google Account is used for identifying you. To give you complete transparency, their data protection and security terms are available [here](https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms#top_of_page).
- Google Analytics for Firebase - I use this service to collect anonymised data about the usage of my app to help improve the app and other services I may provide. Information collected includes, but is not limited to, your device type and model, your operating system version, language, region, app version and other anonymous information. I do not use this information to identify you. Their terms are available [here](https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics/).
- Crashlytics - To help prevent crashes, and to improve your experience, I collect logs when the app crashes or encounters an error. Such data is almost always anonymous and is not intended to track you. Their terms are available [here](https://firebase.google.com/terms/fabric-data-processing-terms). To disable automatic collection and logging of crash data, go to settings and disable crash reporting.
- Authentication - As outlined earlier, you need to sign in to the app with the Google account you used earlier. By signing in to the app, you may provide certain personal information to me. However, Firebase may also collect some other data and use it for facilitating  account management and authentication. Details are available [here](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/#examples_of_end_user_personal_data_processed_by_firebase).

## How long is data stored
As most of the personal data collected is for your end use, it is not deleted directly by me unless requested by you or required by law. Your data stored from v1.0 of the app will be deleted in a phased manner starting 2022.

## Security
While I use the best security tools available to me and design the app to prevent any unauthorized access to your data, I cannot assure you that your data will remain 100% secured. I also rely on 3rd party services to secure your data as outlined above. They have their own security policies and measures. In case I am made aware of a security breach in my app, I will try my best to fix it as fast as possible and either roll out an update or make a server side change as the case may be. Make sure you keep your app up to date.

## Law enforcement requests
Local law enforcement agencies may request your data from me. I will not entertain such requests unless they come through proper legal channels and follow stipulated laws and guidelines. I will follow all laws and regulations and will try my best to protect your data in such cases. Be informed that law enforcement agencies may directly contact the third party agencies listed above for your data. In such cases, their policies are applicable.

## General Information
- Any changes to this policy will be updated here and will come in place 14 days from such a change. If you disagree with any chance, please contact me via email at teamhealersdiary@gmail.com and inform me of the same. Also, immediately stop using the app and other related services. I will delete your data within 30 days from such written requests and disable your account as outlined in my End User License Agreement linked above.
- This policy is governed by local laws and regulations. Any clause may be void where applicable per local laws. 
- This policy was last updated on 23 February, 2021.
